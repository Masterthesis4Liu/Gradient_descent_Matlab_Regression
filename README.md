# Gradient_descent_Matlab_Regression

In this project, i using gradient descent method to achieve the regression.

weil our model is not large(only 586 samples), using another method(normal descent) will much more faster and easier.

but gradient descent method help us to understand the calculate process and we can get the learning curve.
